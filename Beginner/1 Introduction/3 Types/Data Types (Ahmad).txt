<h1 class="chapterSubtitle">Data Types</h1>
<p class="chapterBody"><em>Data types</em> are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming.  In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:</p>
<ol class="chapterOrderedList">
<li class="chapterList"><em>Number</em>: Any number, including numbers with decimals.</li>
<li class="chapterList"><em>String</em>: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes. Though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.</li>
<li class="chapterList"><em>Boolean</em>: This data type only has two possible values — either “true” or “false” (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.</li>
<li class="chapterList"><em>Null</em>: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword “null” (without quotes).</li>
<li class="chapterList"><em>Undefined</em>: This data type is denoted by the keyword “undefined” (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than “null”.</li>
<li class="chapterList"><em>Symbol</em>: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.</li>
<li class="chapterList"><em>Object</em>: Collections of related data.</li>
</ol>
